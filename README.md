Project: Data Modeling with Postgres.

Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly      interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user      activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.



The Dataset of project:

1- Song Dataset:
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The          files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

2- Log Dataset:
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music    streaming app based on specified configurations.

to run the Python scripts:


    1- run create_tables.py 

    2- run etl.py

    3- run test.ipynb to check the result.

files in the repository:

    test.ipynb: displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.

    create_tables.py: drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.

    etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process        for each of the tables.
    etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.
    sql_queries.py contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
    README.md provides discussion on your project.
